# Better Labs Projects Overview

## BetterAI v2

[BetterAI Engine](https://github.com/better-labs/betteraiengine): this service will prioritize iteration of AI and Data pipelines. There are many unexplored designs for AI prediction that need to be generated and measured for accuracy. This service will allow for faster iteration of new AI prediction pipelines, and for the results to be sent to BetterOMS for execution and benchmarking.

[BetterOMS (Order Management System)](https://github.com/better-labs/betteroms): the second most valuable step after generating an AI prediction is to have a system place the bets on your behalf. Instead of manually placing bets based on an AI prediction, there is much more fun and upside to automate many bets based on this signal. Surprisingly - there is no tool that allows any automated Order Management for prediction market users!


## BetterAI v1

[BetterAI Web App](https://github.com/better-labs/betterai-v1): a Next.js prediction market application that integrates with Polymarket, featuring AI-powered market predictions. It enables a non-technical consumer user to invoke multiple AI models with enriched datasets to predict the likely outcome of a given predictionmarket (like Polymarket).
